# ReactBuildSetUp

This repo is the standard buold set up I use for create new React Apps.

This is a relatively lightweight setup that pretty much encapsulates my standard React needs (for now), though I do reserve the right to add more cool things as and when I find them :-)

This is an alternative to a create-react-app (whichc is brilliant BTW) but also demonstrates how to build React in Webpack 4. It also gives me a bit more control over what's built and where.
